The official documentation for the AFK Pool Rewards Minecraft plugin

_Minecraft AFK Pool Rewards Plugin_
####  

**AFKPRewards** brings a nifty little feature that allows you to setup AFK Pools and then grant Economy money to players that are currently within the set pool area! With a simple integration and easy to use config values, **AFKPRewards** will surely keep your server bumpin'!

## Setup
Below there is an image that will display a very simple built **AFK Pool** and this format is necessary for the actually reward system to work:

The pool needs to have a center block the AFK players can wade around whilst they are AFK, _AND_ this is where you will stand when setting the location of the AFK Pool.
